to use the arm control its motions 
to use the and animations for Petteia set the Petteia bool to ture 
this is in place to keep the hand motions from inyerfering with cotobos

to routate the arm use animamator.getfloat(name) or animamator.setfloat(name,vale)
animamator.getfloat(Upper_arm_angle_UP_Down); (-1=down, 1=UP)
animamator.getfloat(Upper_arm_angle_Forward); (0=nutral, 1=forward)
animamator.getfloat(lower_arm_angle); (0=nutral, 1=forward)//dose not work right now

// each animation on the arm as a mask on it other than the cotobos clips 
the mask was set up in the fbx inport settings 
this was needed as the mask cant be set for non-human clips other waise
I added the second arm to bing in the arms movement clips that the origanal did not have
