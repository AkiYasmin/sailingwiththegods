Dark clouds on the horizon,An attempt to appease the gods,Did the ritual help?,What's left after the clouds part,,,,,,,,,,
"Great job! The ritual was a complete success! The storm seems much less fearsome, and you are less likely to capsize and meet a watery end.\n\nYour seer has an idea of the best way out of the storm. There are other paths, but following his directions is likely to lead you to safety.","Some small gods may have heard you, but you see no change in the weather. The clouds are just as thick as before, and rocks loom out through the downpour.",You chose not to perform a ritual at all. Yours will surely be the hardest of passages!,,,,,,,,,,,
A storm has hit! Gods make storms for many different reasons; a ritual that pleases the gods may calm the storm. A seer may know why the gods are angry - do you have on on board?,"Often along the streaming hair of the gray salt water\nThey pray for sweet homecoming won in spite of the sea\n(Archilochus fr. 12, 7th c BC)","The open sea is churning to a wash of waves\nDeep within, A cloud stands upright over the Cyrean caps\nSignal of a storm, and teror rises from the unforseen\n(Archilochus fr. 15, 7th c BC)","Long waves surge, churned up on the sea by the east and south winds, hurtling down from heavens;\nas the west wind sweeps through the high-standing grain\nWith its violent blast, and the ears all shudder and bow\n(Adapted from Iliad 2.131)","The winds crack and crash,\nAs when a wave of the loud-roaring sea\nCrashes upon a beach and the surf keeps resounding\n(Iliad 1.198-200)","The Pleiades flee mighty Orion, and plunge into the misty deep: all the gusty winds are raging!\n(Hesiod Works and Days 620-621)",,,,,,,,
"You say to your crewmate, 'You are a seer, a mortal with the ability to read the signs that the gods put into the natural world, like the flight of birds and the falling of stars. Oh Seer, what has angered the gods?'","The seer determines that Poseidon needs to be soothed, and instructs you to perform the following hymn: \nHoly spirit of the Sea-god Poseidon, mighty earth-shaker, \nBe gracious to others who cross the Aegean sea, \nAs you have gently granted me, \nDriven swiftly by the breezes of Thrace, \nThe harbor I wished to reach \n(Crinagoras, 10.24)","The seer realizes it's the god of the harbor who wants a gift! Perform the following poem for him, singing and dancing together in unison:\nBlessed god of the harbor, send a gentle breeze\nTo the departing sails of Archelaus\nSo that he may sail undisturbed through the waters\nTo the open sea. You who rule the farthest shore,\nGuard the voyager, so that he reaches the Pythian shrine of Apollo.\nIf all singers are dear to him, I will sail with full trust in the fair western wind.\n(Antiphilus 10.17)","The seer knows the tale of Ino's son, and determines he must be the cause of our troubles. Perform this song in his honor, along with a solemn dance performed by your three best sailors:\nO Melicertes, son of Ino, and sea-green
Leukothea, mistress of Ocean, divinity who\nShields from harm; chorus of Nereids and the waves\nAnd you, Lord Poseidon, and Thracian Zephyr.\nMost gentle of winds, carry me propitiously, speeding\nThrough broad smooth waves, safe to the sweet shore\n(Philodemus)","Your seer remembers the importance of Apollo as the god who accompanies ships at departure and return; he tells you to offer a sacrifice at the ship's altar while singing:\nApollo who rules over the steep cliffs of Leukas\nThe cliffs visible to mariners from afar, on which\nThe waters of the Ionian sea crash with foam -\nReceive from these sailors the hand-kneaded barley\nLittle cups of libations, and a flickering lamp with\nIts small bit of oil: in response, send favorable winds,\nRunning with us to the harbors of Actium\n(Philippus)",,,,,,,,,
You say 'We have no Seer with insight into the gods' motives. Let's have our best-known man give the ritual a try.',"A random crewmember takes a guess - who could it be but Poseidon? He stands up and performs the following song to appease the god:\nPoseidon, god who rules swift-sailing ships!\nLover of horses, and denizen of the cliffs of Euboia,\nGrant your worshippers a favorable voyage\nTo the city of Ares!\n(Alphaeus)","Among your crew are those who know the power of Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, when it comes to perils at sea; they suggest a song honoring her, and perform it as follows:\nI promise you, Artemis of the harbor,\nA fine red mullet fish and hake fish, plus\nA cup of wine, full to the brim, and a bit of \nDry bread - the sacrifice of a poor fisherman!\n(Apollonides)","Among your crew are initiates into the Orphic mysteries. They know a hymn for Leukothea, and perform it to draw down her favors: \nI Call Leukothea, child of Kadmos \nNurse of Bacchus, who wears ivy leaves. \nHearken, oh powerful goddess, in the mighty depths of the sea, \nWide and profound, over which you hold swap:\nYou who rejoice in waves and help mankind. \nYou alone grant deliverance to ships \nWhen the storms are raging, \nWhen our skills are failing, \nAnd our strength runs out. \nWhen the billows are angry, \nAnd the sailor overcome. \nYou hear us, you feel pity, and \nAnswer prayers with intervention \nAnd life spared. Be with us always! \nGrant prosperous voyages, bringing \nYour mystics through stormy seas \nTo the shores they long to reach \n(Orphic Hymn 73: To Leukothea)",,,,,,,,,,
"You have escaped the storm! You now set up a nice poem thanking the gods for helping you. Regardless of the ritual from earlier, at this point you realize: good things only happen when the gods are on your side.","Aphrodite was celebrated with epithets Euploia (‘good sailing’) and Zephyrion ('of the gentle west wind, best for sailors'); she was also equated to Arsinoe II, the Ptolemaic queen of Egypt, who through her articulated her own maritime ambitions. Offer her as your means allow - dedicate some seashells, or a fine vase of perfumed oil, a sacrifice of doves, or a statue of the goddess surrounded by the leaping fish of the sea, attended by the west wind. Inscribe it with the following:\nLet us stand on the low beach of the sea-washed promontory,\ngazing at the sanctuary of Kypris of the Sea,\nand the spring overshadowed by poplars from which\nthe yellow kingfishers sip with their bills the running water.\n(Anthologia Palatina IX, 333 (ed. Beckby) - by Mnasalikes, 3rd c BC)","Leukothea attends on heroes in distress. Offer this goddess a bronze tripod worthy of a hero, and on it write:\nThis tripod - gleaming with bronze - I dedicate to Leukothea, merciful goddess of the waves,\nShe of whom Homer sang:\n'Kadmos' daughter, slender-ankled Ino who is also Leukothea; once she had been a mortal and spoken\nwith human voice, but now she lives in the salt seas and the gods give her the honor that is her due'\n(Homer Odyssey 5.333)","Delphin was the daimon who took the shape of a dolphin and served Poseidon: he was dear to Poseidon for the service he rendered when that sea god sought to persuade Amphitrite of his love. The dolphins may be considered their equivalent: those who know the story of the god see the truth behind these sea mammals! Set up for them a statue of a horde of them swimming alongside Poseidon, and write on it:\nThe Delphines both rejoice in the echoing shores and dwell in the deep seas, and there is no sea without Delphines: for Poseidon loves them exceedingly, inasmuch as when he was seeking Amphitrite the dark- eyed daughter of Nereus who fled from his embraces, Delphines (the Dolphins) marked her hiding in the halls of Okeanos (Oceanus) and told Poseidon; and the god of the dark hair straightway carried off the maiden and overcame her against her will. Her he made his bride, queen of the sea, and for their tidings he commended his kindly attendants and bestowed on them exceeding honour for their portion.\n(Oppian, Halieutica 1.383, 3rd c AD)","Nereus, known as the old man of the sea, is famous for being able to change his form, just like the ever-changing surface of the sea. He is also a master of prophecy, a key ritual power when facing the uncertain dangers of ocean voyages. For him, set up a finely carved marble in the shape of a conch shell, and inscribe your offering as follows:\nTruthful Nereus who tells no lies, eldest of his sons. They call him the Old Gentleman (Gerôn) because he is trustworthy, and gentle, and never forgetful of what is right, but the thoughts of his mind are mild and righteous. \n(Hesiod Theogony 235)","Proteus is an old man of the sea, possessor of prophetic power and the shepherd of seals. Give him images of the seals he loves, and honor him with paintings of the many forms he took when he wrestled with Odysseus: first a lion, then a snake, a panther, a boar, running water and finally a tree! (Homer Odyssey 4.365ff)\nProteus I call, whom fate decrees to keep the keys which lock the chambers of the deep; first-born, by whose illustrious power alone all nature's principles were clearly shown. Pure sacred matter to transmute is thine, and decorate with forms all-various and divine. All-honored, prudent, whose sagacious mind knows all that was and is of every kind, with all that shall be in succeeding time, so vast thy wisdom, wondrous and sublime: for all things Nature first to thee consigned, and in thy essence omniform confined. O father, to the mystics' rites attend, and grant, a blessed life a prosperous end.\n(Orphic Hymn 25, trans. Taylor, 3rd-2nd c BC)","To Psamathe, the Sand Goddess, and her child the Seal: If you find yourself, after a storm or battle, suddenly awakening in a quiet harbor full of seals, surrounded by fine sandy shores, make an altar, sacrifice a fish, and inscribe on the altar the following story, to honor the goddess and god who brought you here:\nOf the daughters of Nereus, the Old man of the Sea (halios geron), Psamathe (Sand-Goddess) the fair goddess, was loved by Aiakos (Aeacus) through golden Aphrodite and bare Phokos (Phocus, Seal).\n(Hesiod, Theogony 1003)",,,,,,,
"You are in a very bad situation: your ship is lost, your men have drowned, and you sit bedraggled on a rocky shore with nothing but your memories of the recent trauma. The least you can do is ensure that the souls of your drowned comrades will be taken care of. You set up an empty tomb, as their bodies are lost at sea, and on it inscribe the following poem:","This headstone has your name alone, Stranger, and the sea your body\n(Peek, Griechische Vers-Inschriften 1746.1)","Shedding tears, this empty tomb demands Lysicles’ body back, and blames the gods for the suffering he endured – he who was the first voice of the Academy! The shores and the gray wave possess him now, no one knows where\n(Posidippus, P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309, XIV 3-6)","Think it through, and if ever you were accustomed to sail the waves, do not be a hasty Black Sea sailor, since you look upon the empty tomb of Dorus; some random sea dunes hold him, somewhere far from Parium. \n(Posidippus, P. Mil.VOgl. VIII 309, XIV 11-14)","Black Earth, wherever you hold the good Pythermus – for he met his end under chill Capricorn – shroud him lightly. But if you, Father of the Sea, are now hiding him, leave him unwounded somewhere, easy to spot, on the sparse shore of Kyme, and, Lord of the Sea, return his corpse, as is due, to his fatherland \n(Posidippus, P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309, XIV 19-24)","Leophantus mourned for me, killed at sea, and buried my shipwrecked corpse with care, even though he had little means, as he was traveling through a foreign land. But I am too small to repay this great favor. \n(Posidippus P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309, XIV 25-28)","Blowing with dreadful force, Boreas the North Wind killed the man Archeanax near the wretched island of Skyros, as the man swamp in the Aegean sea, able to see land on both sides. But two stades at sea is longer than great spaces of dry plain. \n(Posidippus P.Mil.Vogl. 309, XIC 7-10)","Every crewmember accompanied the ship as it sank to the floor of the sea. \n(Posidippus P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309, XIV 15-18)","This is a drowned man’s tomb. Stranger, sail on, \nJust as the other ships sailed on while we surrendered to the waves. \n(Theodoridas)","Thymodes also, weeping over sorrows he could not have expected, \nBuilt this empty tomb for his son Lykos, who did not \nGet a grave, even a foreign one, but is held by\nSome Thynian headland or Pontic island. \nThere, without funeral rites, lie his shining bones,\nNaked on a hostile shore \n(Damagetus)","A blasting squall, rushing sharp upon us from the east, \nAnd dark night, and the waves of the dark setting of \nOrion – these were my end! I, Callaeschus, lost my grip \nOn life as I sped along the mid-Libyan sea: \nNow I roll, drifting, in the ocean, \nFood for fish, and this stone lies, declaring it stands above me. \n(Leonidas of Tarentum)","The sea is the sea is the sea – everywhere you go. \nWhy Do we blame in vain the Cyclades for this, the Hellespont for that, \nThe ‘eye of the needle’ for its challenges? They are famously hard, \nBut with no good reason. If not, why is it that once I escaped \nTheir clutches, I met my fate in the harbor of Scarphe? Go ahead, \nPray for a safe passage. Aristagoras, who is buried here, knows that \nThe sea is the sea is the sea. \n(Antipater of Sidon)","O mariners, o sailors! Ariston of Cyrene begs you all, \nIn the name of Zeus the Protector, to tell \nHis father Meno that his body lies on the Icarian rocks, \nThat he gave up the ghost in the Aegean Sea \n(Theaetetus)","Stranger passing by! I mourn for Polyanthus. His wife, \nSoon after their nuptials, placed his dust and bones into a grave. \nThe foul-flowing wave of the Aegean did him in off Sciathus; \nIt was fishermen, stranger, who at first light drew his sorry corpse into the harbor of Torone. \n(Phaedimus)"
