Dr. Sandra Blakely  Project Director, Emory University, Department of Classics

Sandra Blakely is an Associate Professor of Classics at Emory University, where her research integrates anthropological, archaeological and Classical approaches to Greek religion and myth.  Her foci include mystery cults, the fragmentary Greek historians Herodoros, Conon and Alexander Polyhistor, and the daimones associated with metallurgy as well as with the Samothracian rites.  In her current book project, The Anthropology of an Island Cult: Maritime Networks and the cult of the Great Gods of Samothrace, she brings Social Network Analysis and Geographic Information Systems to the epigraphic record of the Great Gods of Samothrace, to test the hypothesis that the safety at sea the Samothracian rites promised was a social reality as well as a mythic metaphor.


Robert C. Bryant  Lead Programmer and Simulation Designer, University of Pennsylvania

Robert Bryant is the Lead Programmer and Simulation Designer behind the Samothracian Networks game Sailing with the Gods: Argonauts and Samothracians in an Ancient Sea. He completed his Masters degree in Computer Science at Georgia State University, and has worked on projects from 3D Atlanta to the ongoing archaeological field research in Oglangala, Azerbaijan (Naxivan). His work on the gamification of the Great Gods of Samothrace is one among many contributions to gaming, history and digital design. Hes currently the Programmer for the UPenn Museum TARA project, and a PhD Student in the UPenn Anthropology department.
Joanna C. Mundy  Digital Projects Specialist, Emory Center for Digital Scholarship



Joanna Mundy is a Digital Projects Specialist in the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship. Also as a PhD candidate at Emory University, in her dissertation she explores the built domestic environment in ancient urban houses, domus and insulae, in the city of Rome in the first to fifth century CE and includes a social network analysis of households in the fourth century city. Her work for Samothracian Networks includes mySQL database design, so that the project database interacts with geospatial and network data. She works with network analysis software, produces network visualizations, and manages the website.
Sara E. Palmer  Digital Text Specialist, Emory Center for Digital Scholarship



Sara Palmer received an MA in Film and Media Studies from Emory University in 2012. At the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship, she consults with researchers on creating online exhibits, designing databases, generating network visualizations, and performing textual markup and analysis.

Alex Jester  Research Assistant, Agnes Scott College



Alex Jester is pursuing a B.A. in Classical Languages and Literatures at Agnes Scott College, where she also works at Information Technology Services. She is especially interested in the intersection of Classics and technology, and plans to pursue a career that incorporates this overlap. She researches numismatic data for Samothracian Networks.
Joe Fritsch  Digital Scholarship Associate, Emory Center for Digital Scholarship



In his research Joe Fritsch, PhD candidate in English, focuses on the intersection of global Anglophone poetry and histories of technology. He supports Samothracian Networks in 3D modelling for the Game. His interest in CAD and 3D design comes from first hand witness of the importance of space to literacy while managing ILS databases in a New York pubic library; he recently used CAD software to recreate the floor plan of the Globe Theatre in order to teach students about Shakespeares London and digital methods.
