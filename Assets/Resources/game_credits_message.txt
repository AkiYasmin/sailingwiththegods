Sandra Blakely is an Associate Professor of Classics at Emory University, where her research integrates anthropological, archaeological and Classical approaches to Greek religion and myth.  Her foci include mystery cults, the fragmentary Greek historians Herodoros, Conon and Alexander Polyhistor, and the daimones associated with metallurgy as well as with the Samothracian rites.  In her current book project, The Anthropology of an Island Cult: Maritime Networks and the cult of the Great Gods of Samothrace, she brings Social Network Analysis and Geographic Information Systems to the epigraphic record of the Great Gods of Samothrace, to test the hypothesis that the safety at sea the Samothracian rites promised was a social reality as well as a mythic metaphor.

Dr. Joanna C. Mundy – Digital Projects Specialist, Emory Center for Digital Scholarship

Joanna Mundy is a Digital Projects Specialist in the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship. She received her PhD from Emory University in Art History, 2018. For her dissertation she explored the built domestic environment in ancient urban houses, domūs and insulae, in the city of Rome in the first to fifth century CE and includes a social network analysis of households in the fourth century city. Her work for Samothracian Networks includes mySQL database design, so that the project database interacts with geospatial and network data. She works with network analysis software, produces network visualizations, and manages the website.
