0@-1@Welcome to the Argonautica Jason! Find your way through the dangerous seas to complete your quest!@void@-1@1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_10_11_12_13_14_15_16_17_18_20_21_22_23_24_25_26_27_28@-1
1@309@Find your way to Pagasse!  Do not look too far!@"The people of Pagasae are amazed at the splendor of the crew, but sad to see you, Jason, depart.  Your ship is the Argo, built by Argus with Athena’s aid, and fitted with a timber from the sacred grove of Dodona.  There the priests would interpret the voice of Zeus as manifested in the wind blowing through the leaves of these trees and the birds which rested in their branches. This piece of timber allows the Argo to express itself with a voice of its own. Your crew then built an altar to Apollo.  You invoked the gods and sacrificed water, barley, and two rams.  At night, the crew drank wine and feasted.  Your crew voted to make Herakles the captain of the ship, but Herakles humbly declined the title, offering it to you as the man whose task this is. Orpheus sings the crew a beautiful song of the beginning of the Earth and the war of the gods and then they go to sleep.  In the morning you and your crew set sail for Aea in the East."@-1@-1@-1
2@388@"Find your way to the Tomb of Dolops! While you sail for the Tomb of Dolops, keep a keen eye and you will pass the headland of Tisaia.  After passing Tisaia, it is worthwhile to watch for the crags of Pelion, for they will guide your way.  You may see the island of Skiathos off to the east as you head northwest to the Tomb of Dolops."@"You have arrived at the tomb of Dolops! He was a mortal son of Hermes, the god of travelers.  It seems he wanted some ritual attention: after you spend two days offering sheep at his tomb, the winds and the waves calm down, and you are able to depart. You are so excited to resume the journey that you rename the place ‘Departure of the Argo’."@386_319_366@-1@-1
3@67@"Find your way to Lemnos! As you sail for Lemnos, you might glimps the hills of Pallene, the cape of Canastra, or the peaks of Athos along the way."@"You have arrived at Lemnos – beware of powerful women!  On this island, you will see that Aphrodite is not to be mocked. The women of Lemnos some time ago ignored the rites of the goddess of love. She punished them with a smell so awful that their husbands would not sleep with them, and turned instead to the Thracian captives they brought from the mainland. But the women took their revenge – and long knives – into their own hands, killing every man on the island. They are now eager for male companionship! The women offer you housing and supplies, and hope to repopulate the island with Argonaut children.  They will lie to you about the reasons for the women-only island, and Hypsipyle herself, the queen, will seduce you. A long dalliance lies ahead here, and only Herakles will shame you back to the oars. Should you return, Hypsipyle will make you king of the island. For now, take those supplies and go on to Samothrace! "@310_168_152@-1@-1
4@1@"Find your way to Samothrace! Let us head straight northeast, where the mountain of the island looms high over the horizon. Here we will experience the secret rites which  cannot be revealed. If we keep our oath of silence regarding their contents, we will  sail in greater safety over the chilling sea."@"You have arrived at Samothrace - more than this you must not say, for the gods will punish those who reveal the mysteries.  "@1@-1@-1
5@197@"Find your way to Cyzicus! On the way to Cyzicus, you will pass between Thrace, to your north, and Imbros, to your southwest.  This will lead you to the Hellespont, which you must pass through!"@"You have arrived at Cyzicus - great work! It was no small task to sail up the Bosporus. Here you meet the Doliones and King Cyzicus, who offer you every hospitality. You build an altar to Apollo, sacrifice and feast together. In the morning, you and the crew climb up mount Dindymum to map out your route, and encounter the less friendly inhabitants of Cyzicus, the Earthborn men. These are monstrous in form: six arms spring from every body. Your crew, led by Herakles, conquers them with ease, and you set sail. But at night the winds drive you back to Cyzicus.  Unable to see through the darkness, the Doliones think you are enemies, and a battle ensues in which you kill your good friend the king. This is disastrous! You linger for three days to mourn properly, and then find that hostile winds prevent your departure for another twelve days. The solution comes in the night: a halcyon, bird of the sea, appears over your head as you sleep and utters prophecy and instructions. Mopsos, master of augury, understands the bird’s speech, and tells you what to do. You and the Argonauts climb again to the top of Dindymum and fashioned a wooden image of the goddess Rhea out of a sturdy trunk of vine.  You pour libations, pray, and dance in your war-gear while beating your shields with swords.  This is the Phrygian dance in honor of Rhea, mother of the gods! Raucous and ecstatic, it satisfies the goddess and the aggrieved spirit of the king. Favorable winds fill you sails, and you leave Cyzicus at last.  "@382_47_235@-1@-1
6@289@Find your way to Mysia! Keep Rhyndakos to your south as you sail east to Mysia.  You will find it by way of the mouth of the Kios river.@"You have arrived at Mysia! The locals are friendly: you sacrifice to Apollo-of-disembarkation and feast well. Herakles and Hylas go into the woods, Heracles to fashion a new oar to replace the one he has broken, Hylas to gather water for the crew.  But the nymph of the spring is much too friendly, and pulls Herakles’ beloved companion into the stream. Polyphemus hears Hylas scream; he and Herakles rush off in separate directions to find their young comrade. When morning comes, the ship sets set sail at Tiphys’s urging. Only after a great distance do you realize that you have left three crewmates behind. You decide not to turn back when Glaucus, a god of the sea, emerges from the waves to tell you that each hero is destined for other tasks: Hylas to marry the nymph that abducted him, Herakles to begin his twelve labors, and Polyphemus to stay in Mysia and found a glorious city.  "@346_256@-1@14_11_27
7@156@Make your way to Bebrycia! Turn back at the Gulf of Olbia toward Bebrycia in the west.@"You have arrived at Bebrycia: dangers await. Here King Amycus has a strange and evil custom: he kills foreigners, either sacrificing them to Poseidon or killing them in a boxing match. He boxes with hard, weighted, spiked leather gloves. Thankfully Polydeuces is up for the task! After a long struggle Polydeuces kills the king. A battle ensues with all the Bebrycians, but you and the Argonauts triumph, with no losses. Together you celebrate with a sacrifice and a feast, and the next day set sail for Thynia."@227@-1@-1
8@384@"Make your way to Thynia! Now you must set your sites east again, and find the narrow Bosphorus as a path to your destination."@"You have arrived at Thynia: beware the Harpies, ‘The Hounds of Zeus’! They are the female spirits of sudden gusts of wind: here they are punishing Phineus, a seer who angered Zeus by giving prophecies that were too accurate.  The Harpies torment him daily, snatching away any morsel of food before he can put it in his mouth. Phineus promises that he will help you, if you can end this agony. You and your men set a trap, placing food before the starving man. When the Harpies swoop in, Zetes and Calais, spring into action. They are the sons of Boreas the god of the North wind, and together chase the Harpies back to Crete. Here Iris orders them not to hurt the Harpies, and instructs the Harpies never to bother Phineus again. They return, and you and your men rejoice, and hear from Phineus what awaits you. The next morning you build an altar to the local gods and then leave Thynia for Thynias, the island which lies nearby."@162@-1@-1
9@385@Make your way to Thynias!  Watch for the river Rhebas and the peaks of Kolone to your south as you head to Thynias.@"You arrived at Thynias! It was a close call: you only escaped the Clashing Rocks because of Athena’s intervention.  On this desert island you see Apollo himself riding his chariot across the sky. You build an altar to him as Lord of the Dawn, while your men dance, pour libations and sing. After three days you sail on to the Cape of Acherusias."@342_256@-1@-1
10@169@"Find your way to the Cape of Acherusa!  Pass the mouth of the river Sangarius on your way to the Cape of Acherusias. The Acherusian headland rises aloft with steep cliffs, looking towards the Bithynian sea; and beneath it smooth rocks, ever washed by the sea, stand rooted firm; and round them the wave rolls and thunders loud, but above, wide-spreading plane trees grow on the topmost point."@"You have sailed through the night to reach Acherusias  - warm welcome and great loss both await you here! This is the land of the Mariandyni, ruled by good king Lycus, who recalls Herakles’ aid to his family in times past. They welcome you as heroes for having conquered Amycus; the king sends his own son, Dasyclus, to accompany you on your journey.  Here you lose both Idmon the seer and Tiphys the helmsman, burying them both in great barrows near the sea.  Ancaeus takes Tiphys’ place, and you leave the Cape of Acherusias for Lycus."@359@30@16_29
11@274@"Sail to Lyra!  On the way to Lyra you will pass the mouth of the river Callichorus, ""River of Gorgeous Dancing."" It was here, ""as the tale goes, the Nysean son of Zeus, when he had left the tribes of the Indians and came to dwell at Thebes, held revels and arrayed dances in front of a cave, wherein he passed unsmiling sacred nights, from which time the neighbours call the river by the name of Callichorus and the cave Aulion."@"You have reached Lyra!  Here you see the ghost of the brave hero Sthenelus, who emerges from the underworld to feast his eyes on the sight of heroes as mighty as himself. He was a companion of Herakles in the hero’s quest to steal the girdle of the Amazon queen; an Amazon arrow took his life, but Herakles himself built the barrow for his friend. Here you follow Mopsos’ advice and stop at the shore, propitiating the hero with libations and building an altar to Apollo, Savior of Ships.  Orpheus sets up his own lyre as an offering to the god – and for his gift the place is named. The next morning you sail out for Assyria."@349@-1@-1
12@149@"Look for Assyria! To reach Assyria you must pass the stream of Parthenius as it flows into the sea, then Sesamus and Cromna, and finally pass around Carambis on your way."@"You have landed on the Assyrian land.  This is the land of Sinope, whom Zeus tried to seduce by telling her that he would grant her anything she wanted. She eluded him by saying what she wanted was her virginity. She used the same tactic to escape Halys and Apollo.  You and the Argonauts meet Deilon, Autolycus, and Phlogius, men who were stranded after accompanying Hercules on his journey to the Amazons.  Together you spend the night here and they join you as you set sail for the Thermodon River!"@316_363_192_171@34_35_36@-1
13@380@Make your way to Thermodon!  The River Halys meets the sea in between these Assyrian lands and your next stop of Thermodon.@"You have arrived in the Thermodon River, icy cold.  Here live the Amazons, the powerful female warriors who have no fondness for the Greeks!  You have a close call here – the winds take you off to Ares' island before you meet them. "@350@-1@-1
14@226@"Eastward, and on to the Island of Ares--Giresun! "@"You have landed at the island of Ares - here the Amazons worship Ares. It is also the home of deadly birds, who shoot their feathers like arrows! You cannot win by shooting at them, but you and your men scare them off by clanging your spears and shields together.  Here you meet the sons of Phrixus himself, the very man who had brought the Golden Fleece to Aea. They washed ashore here after a shipwreck, and are very glad to get off this wretched island and help you. You are finally off to the Phasis river!"@-1@31@-1
15@402@Look for the Phasis River! Head toward the steep crags of the Caucasian mountains on the way to the Phasis River.  You will see the city of Aea nearby.@"You have arrived at the land of the Golden Fleece! You put in by night at the river Phasis; in the morning, you and your men go to Aea to convince King Aeetes to give you the Golden Fleece. But the king has no wish to part with his treasure, and says you may take the fleece only if you first yoke fire breathing bulls, plow and plant a four acre field, and kill the army of men who will emerge from the soil. Grief strikes you and the crew: surely this is impossible! But Aphrodite intervenes.  She strikes Medea, the daughter of Aeetes, with a consuming passion for you.  Medea, a powerful magician, mixes up a potion that grants you superhuman strength and protection, but only for a very short period of time. With this help you complete Aeetes’ tasks with ease.  Aeetes does not keep his word, and gathers an army to attack you. Medea catches wind of this, and concocts another potion, one that will put the serpent that guards the fleece. In exchange, you promise to take Medea with you to Greece and protect her from her father.  Finally you snatch the fleece and sail to Paphlagonia!"@173_123@-1@-1
16@311@Sail to Paphlagonia!  You will need to return back by the River Halys to reach Paphlagonia.@"Medea has ordered you to stop at Paphlagonia.  You need to perform rites in honor of the goddess Hecate, thanking her for all her help on your quest thus far.  You follow Medea’s instructions, and perform sacrifice and unspeakable rites. Next you recount Phineus’ prophecy that you would not sail back the way you came: you set sail for Bryges!"@350@32@-1
17@163@Look for Bryges!  The only way to reach Bryges is to find and follow the Ister River.@"You arrive at one of the dual islands of Bryges, sacred to Artemis.  Here you meet Apsyrtus, the son of Aeetes and brother of Medea.  He tries to make a deal with you: you may keep the fleece, but must return Medea. Medea persuades you to resist this offer. You set a trap during the presumed drop off and kill Apsyrtus and the Colchians that had accompanied him.  You then sail off to the Holy Island of Electra"@252@-1@-1
18@238@The Holy Island of Electra is your next destination!  Head west across the sea: this island looms near the river Eridanus.@You evade the pursuing Colchians and stop on the Holy Island of Electra to catch some rest.  Once you are rested you sail on to the City of Hyllus.@218@-1@-1
19@185@Look toward the City of Hyllus!  Head southeast to the City of Hyllus.@"Congratulations, you made it to the City of Hyllus!  The Hyllean people welcome you, for you give them one of the two tripods that Apollo himself had given you, Jason. This is a wise gift. It has the power to protect their city from attack: they bury it deep underground.  You wish to see King Hyllus, the son of Hercules, but he had already left the island.  You must be purified from the murder of Apsyrtus: this means that you must go to Circe, who can perform this rite!  "@-1@-1@-1
20@370@You must find Circe: she lies beyond the Stoechades!  Follow the Eridanus River to the Rhone River and then go back out to sea.@"To find Circe you must sail up the Eridanus: here is where Phaethon crashed to earth when he failed to steer the chariot of Helios his father. The poplar nymphs weep tears of amber, and a stench fills the air, but you sail through safely. Then you sail up the Rhodanus, and stormy Celtic lakes; you nearly take a wrong turn into the stream of Ocean, from which there is no return! Hera intervenes and you sail on, covered by a mist as you pass through the land of Celts and Ligyans.  Finally you see the Stoechades – a welcome sight! "@218_345@-1@-1
21@403@Find your way to Aethalia! Head southeast and you will see the Gray Island@"You put in at Aethalia!  Here you wipe the sweat from your bodies with the pebbles on the beach, which ever after take on the color of scrapings from skin. Arrows and armor of your crew can still be seen here; the place of your landing is named Harbor of the Argo. The next day you are on to Aeaea."@-1@-1@-1
22@124@Make your way to Aeaea!  Continue to follow the coast south to Aeaea.  Keep an eye out for Romans and Etruscans!@"You have arrived at Aeaea, the island of Circe, Medea’s aunt and a powerful witch!  Circe has had a terrifying dream that the walls of her palace were running with blood. You and your men see her as she is cleansing herself in the salt spray of the sea, attended by strange creatures of mixed limbs. She detects the nature of your visit without a word, and performs the sacrifices to cleanse you and Medea, as suppliants, from the stain of murder. Only once the rites are done, can Medea tell your story, Jason: you do not speak in Circe’s presence.  You are told to leave the island – how can you not obey? You head for the shores of Drepane."@-1@-1@-1
23@208@"Find a way to Drepane!  Continue to follow the coast south and enter the straight when you see Scylla.  Begin to look east when you pass the Wandering Rocks, and then continue east to Drepane."@"After narrowly escaping both the Sirens and the Wandering Rocks, you arrive at Drepane.  But awaiting you here are the rest of the Colchians who traveled back through the Bosporus and cut you off.  They want to take Medea away from you.  King Alcinous will comply with the Colchian’s demands, unless you and Medea have been married. Your crew conducts a hasty wedding, the Colchians are sent home empty handed, and it seems that your luck has held up… for now.  You sail off to Syrtis."@360_392@-1@7
24@371@"Make a journey to Syrtis! Sail out with the fresh breeze from Zeus.  Head far southwest, crossing south of Sicily and the Wandering Rocks, and sail until you see Syrtis."@"Oh no! The North wind has blown you all the way down to the coast of Libya!   Your ship is stuck on the shores of Syrtis, where the water is too shallow and full of reefs to sail back out to sea and even if it were manageable there is no wind to sail by.  The entire crew is in despair, but your spirits are brought up by the prophecies of Libyan nymphs that come to visit you.  Once their prophecies are told, a horse jumps Oh no! The North wind has blown you all the way down to the coast of Libya!   Your ship is stuck on the shores of Syrtis, where the water is too shallow and full of reefs to sail back out to sea and even if it were manageable there is no wind to sail by.  The entire crew is in despair, but your spirits are revived by the prophecies of Libyan nymphs that come to visit you.  Once their prophecies are told, a horse jumps out from the sea and runs inland.  You see this as a sign and are able to rally the crew to carry the Argo on their back inland in the direction that the horse ran, towards Lake Triton."@392@33@-1
25@261@Travel to Lake Triton!  Carry your ship on your shoulders until you reach Lake Triton - and gain refreshing water!@"After many days of carrying the ship you have finally reached Lake Triton!  The lake is filled with a foul stench from the decaying carcass of Ladon, the dragon who used to guard the golden apples in the garden of Atlas.  The nymphs of the Hesperides are mourning his loss. Orpheus inquires of them, and learns that Herakles himself killed the beast. You are overjoyed! Does this mean he is here, and can rejoin the crew? But though your crew looks for him everywhere, you cannot find him.  More sad events happen here: Canthus dies, as was foretold for him, as well as Mopsus the seer. You mourn and bury your friends: how will you find your route, with Mopsus gone? Orpheus provides the answer: you should offer to the god of the lake the second tripod Apollo gave you.  This works! Triton appears, happy with the gift, and tells you how to leave the lake.  You and your men sacrifice a sheep to him, and the god himself carries your boat to the open sea. Off to Crete!"@-1@-1@-1
26@190@"Sail to Crete! Head east to Crete. If you see Carpathus, you must follow the islands back to the west.  If you see the Peloponnesus, you have not gone far enough to the east."@"Once you reach Crete, you meet a new challenge: the island is guarded by Talos, a giant man of bronze who walks around the circumference of the island three times a day.  Medea conquers him for you, casting a spell that makes him graze his ankle on a rock and spill out his ichor, the fluid that animates him. You and the Argonauts then spend the night here and create an altar to Athena in the morning.  You then set sail for Anaphe."@172_321@-1@8_21
27@136@"Look for a way to Anaphe! Head north to that bare island they call Anaphe, watching for the nearby tiny isle of Hippouris."@"You were lost in the dark at sea until Apollo leaped down from heaven onto the island’s rocks, and held up his gleaming golden bow. That flashing light led you here, so you name the place ‘Anaphe’, ‘The Island of Revealing’.  You want to make a thank offering to Apollo but have nothing but at this point have little more than water to pour as libations.  Medea’s maidens, accustomed to the finery of the palace in Colchis, find this enormously amusing. They mock you, you and the men mock them back: comic relief! After some rest, you and your crew set sail for Aegina."@237@-1@-1
28@126@Find a path to Aegina!  Navagate northwest through a series of small islands to Aegina.@"While at sea, Euphemus dreams that the clod of dirt that had been given to him by Triton turned into a lovely maiden.  You, Jason, recognize what this means, and convince him to throw the clod into the sea. Up rises the island of Calliste rises up from the very place the dirt entered the water. You then dock on the shores of Aegina and rest in order that you arrive at Pagasae on the next day!"@-1@-1@-1
29@309@It's time to go home! Return to Pagasse!  You will need to skirt the land of Euboea to reach again Pagasae.@"You have arrived at Pagasae.  You are very weary from many days of travel, but are happy to have finally completed your quest!"@221@-1@-1
