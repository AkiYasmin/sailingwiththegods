1@{0}'s eye has been having a nervous twitch. The seer says that the twitcher saw something in the temple that he should not have seen! The offender must make an offering of incense on the altar located at the prow of the ship.@0.7@15@15@-1@0
1@{0}'s hand has been twitching convulsively. The Seer says that this means he robbed a sanctuary. He must perform a hymn and dance to the god of the temple he robbed and swear an oath to give that god a tithe of his profits this journey.@0.6@12@12@-1@0
1@"{0} has brought along astragali, ancient dice used to forecast the future. The Seer throws the dice. The answer reveals that one of the crew slandered the gods before leaving port.

1@"{0} has brought along astragali, ancient dice used to forecast the future. The Seer throws the dice. The answer reveals that one of the crew slandered the gods before leaving port. He should sacrifice a baby goat to the god he slandered, but as you do not have a goat, he must carry water around the ship three times and then cast it into the sea."@0.3@20@20@0@50
0@"We think that because {0} has been having dreams of adopting a baby fish and that fish then eating him, we should try making an offering to the nereids."@0.2@0@0@-1@0
0@We think that because {0}'s eye has had a nervous twitch he saw something in the temple that he should not have seen! We should throw him overboard as a sacrifice.@0.4@0@0@-2@1
0@We think that because {0}'s hand has been twitching convulsively this means he robbed a sanctuary. We should build a shrine to that god at the next port and leave all of {0}'s possessions there as an offering along with a nice poem apologizing.@0.35@0@0@-3@1000
0@"{0} has brought along astragali, ancient dice used to forecast the future. We cast the dice and they turned up the number 5. We understand this as an invitation to offer five things to the gods: a lock of hair, someone's cloak, a sheep, a goat, and a golden ring."@0.45@0@0@11@2

Unfortunately, we don't have a sheep and a goat, so we will have to hope the other three are enough."@0.15@0@0@-1@0
