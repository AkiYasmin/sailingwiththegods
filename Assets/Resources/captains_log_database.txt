0@"Today a crew member rambled on about Apollo again:   ""The lord of the unerring bow, The god of life, and poetry, and light, The Sun, in human limbs arrayed, and brow. All radiant from his triumph in the fight. The shaft has just been shot; the arrow bright with an immortal's vengeance; in his eye, And nostril, beautiful disdain, and might, And majesty flash their full lightnings by, Developing in that one glance the Deity."""
0@"This guy won't stop going on about Apollo:  ""Music exalts each joy, allays each grief, Expels disease, softens every pain; And hence the wise of ancient days adored One power of physic, melody, and song."""
0@Apparently someone had Hyacinthus on board which caused quite a stir. Other sailors were worried about Zephyr's envy and threw it over board. As the gods would have it, others were worried about Poseidon's reaction to the flowers. I alotted more wine today to alleviate their concerns.
0@I had an argument with a drunken crew member today. Hateful to me as the gates of Hades is that man who hides one thing in his heart and speaks another.
0@If we run low on food on this long voyage--I do not trust this crew. Miserable mortals who, like leaves, at one moment flame with life, eating the produce of the land, and at another moment weakly perish.
0@A crewmember caused some trouble with another last night. Once harm has been done, even a fool understands it.
0@These boys I hired...They require wisdom. Young men's minds are always changeable, but when an old man is concerned in a matter, he looks both before and after. 
0@"Someone had a terrible dream last night of wreck and ruin. It was causing trouble on board. I think I allayed their anxieties by alotting more wine and telling them ""Dreams surely are difficult, confusing, and not everything in them is brought to pass for mankind. For fleeting dreams have two gates: one is fashioned of horn and one of ivory. Those which pass through the one of sawn ivory are deceptive, bringing tidings which come to nought, but those which issue from the one of polished horn bring true results when a mortal sees them. """""""
0@A drunk sailor was going on again about the creation of the world. Not that I don't enjoy a long tale( if told well), but it is tedious to tell again tales already plainly told by others better.
1@Ahhh...Samothrace, the island of mystery, (and benefits if we're lucky!)
1@The island of Samothrace--if I can convince them to let me go through their rites...maybe I can breathe a little easier from these pirates!
9@Land of man-eating horses! This city was founded by Abderos, the companion of Herakles who was killed and eaten by the man-eating horses of Diomedes, king of Thrace. Abderas was a son of Poseidon and the Naiad Thronia; he is celebrated in athletic contests here.  
10@Lovers and swimmers belong here! This is the mythical home of Leander, the lover of Hero, a priestess of Aphrodite who lived in a tower in Sestos on the other side of the channel.  Leander would swim the Hellespont every night to see her, guided by the lamp Hero would light and place in a tower to guide his way. 
12@Cilicia has deep Phoenician roots! The region is named for Cilix, the son of Agenor, brother of Kadmos and Phoenix; all three went searching for Europa after she eloped with Zeus in the form of a bull. Cilix only got as far as Asia Minor, where with his followers he established the population of the region. Greek legend claims these are Syrian.
12@This is the home of Apollonius of Tyana, a holy man famous for working miracles which pagan writers claimed were more powerful than Jesus’.  
12@ Adonis, the handsome youth beloved of the Great Mother goddess, is celebrated here: eventually emperor Constantine will demand that his temple be destroyed.  Eusebius describes the Phoenician shrine as a place where men dressed as women, and unmentionable practices were regularly carried out.  
11@The Aeolian people have divine origins – they are descendants of Aeolus, King of the Winds 
14@Thracian royal families consider Hermes their ancestor; he is shown here as a pillar-like statue placed on a throne. 
14@Here the cults of Hermes, the god of commerce, of theft, and of travel, are strong, appropriate for a wealthy port town!
15@This city was founded in legend by a Carian hero, Alabandus, whose name combines the words for ‘horse’ and ‘victory’ or ‘competition’. Local Apollo is known as Isotimos, “Equal in Honor to Zeus”; his sister Artemis has a temple here as well.
17@BEWARE THE MOUSE!  Here we meet the native god Smintheus, who is assimilated to Asklepius as a god of healing and to Apollo as the god who can destroy the mice who eat grain, carry pestilence, and attack the fields. They are vermin who must be destroyed! 
19@Dionysos on the city coins holds a big Kantharos – let’s plan on heading to the tavern! This place was founded by Aeolians.
20@A bronze smith, Markos Kaikelios Sotas, dedicated an object from his craft to the Great Gods of Samothrace; was he cheered by the closeness of Kabeiroi to Hephaistos on Lemnos?
20@This town controls an important land route, right where it crosses the Strymon river, the road which will become the  Via Egnatia
20@We will trade here! There are rich mines in the Pangaeum mountains, and wood and tar to repair our ships.
22@Here the local people know what it means to be saved from a watery death! Some celebrate this as the landing place of Noah’s ark: others tell how the king’s own son stopped a flood by riding on horseback straight into the heart of the local spring.  
23@Named for the great queen of Egypt! We may invoke this powerful woman’s own spirit as we sail into port: bride of her brother, patron of Samothrace, and deified as Aphrodite of Safe Sailing.
25@This is the island of a reluctant love! Poseidon fell in love with the Phoenician princess Astypalaea, but she was not in love with  him! She turned into a fish-tailed leopard to flee his embrace. Who can elude a god? He tracked her down, brought her here, and made her the mother of sons.   One of them is on our ship: Ankaios the helmsman!
26@City of Athena, center of Greece: “City of light, with thy violet crown, beloved of the poets, thou art the bulwark of Greece.” 
29@Bellerophon, conqueror of the Chimaera, founded this city in honor of his friend Bargylos, who died after being kicked by Pegasos, Bellerophon’s winged horse.
29@Here is a temple of Artemis Cindyas: rain falls around the temple, but never touches the structure 
30@The tomb of Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, lies near here!
31@City on the Bosporos! The Bosporos is the ‘cow crossing’: here Io, turned into a heifer and driven by the gadfly of Hera, crossed from Europe to Asia; here too she gave birth to her child, Keroessa, the daughter of Zeus.  The girl, in name and form, perpetuated her mother’s suffering: two horn-like bulges marked her forehead, and her name means ‘The Horned Girl.’  Poseidon, however, found her more beautiful than the nymphs of Thrace, and made her the mother of a son, Byzas: this city bears his name.  
33@Time for us to stock up on wine!  It has a divine origin at this place: here King Oinopionos, son of Dionysos and Ariadne and grandson of King Minos of Crete, taught the people of the island to cultivate vines.
33@Here we will see the weeping trees: the mastic trees, from whose bark ooze the tear-shaped drops of mastic. Only here, in all the world, do these trees grow, thriving in the southern part of the island  Some claim the island is named for the Phoenician word for this resin. Egyptians use it to embalm the dead, Herodotus says the sticky stuff is harvested from the beards of he-goats, as it clings to their long hairs when they come to munch on the trees that produce it. (3.112) Dioscorides knew that it “is diuretical, makes unstable teeth firm when washed with it, and its green sprigs are effective in cleaning teeth. The resin alone, when drunk, is good for bleeding exportations, old coughs, the stomach (but it causes belching), stimulating hair growth on eyebrows, and is good in toothpaste because it cleans, makes white, strengthens, and gives good breath”   Egyptians use it in the process of mummification.  
34@This city was founded by a prince of Samothrace – he fled his native land when a flood burst from the Hellespont, and threatened to engulf all souls.  He sailed on the most primitive craft, a raft of skins. Some people know a different Dardanos, a powerful magician who wrote books on magic: the Sword of Dardanos figures in Greek magical papyri as part of a love spell.
35@This is the island of Apollo; here he and his sister Artemis were born when Leto, fleeing from Hera’s wrath, sought the world over for a place to give birth.  Zeus called on Poseidon to create the island to help his lover – the sea god thrust his trident into the sea and the island appeared: ‘Delos’ means ‘appearance’.
35@From this tiny island, long lines of connection run to the far north, the land of the Hyperboreans. Some say that Leto was chased to the island by a pack of Hyperborean wolves, and that Eileithyia, the goddess who aids childbirth, traveled from the chilly northern reaches to aid Leto in her labor.  After the birth, the Hyperboreans sent pilgrims and virgin priestesses to the island – but the maidens were killed, and ever after the northern folk send their offerings through a long line of carriers, moving from one tribe to another. The gifts are small – sacred items covered in wheat straw. We will see  the tomb of the Hyperborean Maidens if we put in to this site: here the boys and girls of Delos offer locks of their hair, seeking their protection 
8@Cybele is here! She is the Great Goddess of Anatolia, Phrygia, Thrace and Greece; in this place she is Pontian Mother of Gods, and she owns fields, vineyars, and workshops.  She comes to Rome late in the second century BC, to bring victory in the Punic war. Her temple here has yielded many gifts. When we see the goddess in this space, she is seated on a throne, a lion in her lap, a scepter in one hand, and a vessel for offerings in the other.
8@This city was founded at a place of natural springs, so was first named Krounoi: but when a wooden statue of the god Dionysos washed ashore, it was renamed for the god of wine. 
37@Herakles knows this place! Here he labored to clean the filthy stables of King Augeias: cleverly, the great hero diverted the river to plunge through the stalls and wash away years of dung.
38@Artemis as the Lady of Ephesus looks unlike the Artemis we have seen! She stands stiff as a pillar; she has dozens of breasts, and wears a cloth decorated with hundreds of animals. Her crown is made of city walls, and her temple is one of the wonders of the world. Great men from all over the world have paid for its columns: we will meet many traders here!
38@Long ago this place was founded by an Athenian Greek – Androklos son of Kodros, king of Athens. He inquired at the oracle of Apollo at Delphi where he should build his city: the god told them to look for the fish and the boar.  This was a great puzzle! They sailed to Asia Minor, and put in at this shoreline.  They caught fish for dinner – hardly the meal of heroes! – and were frying them over the open flame. The fish leaped out of the pan, scattering flames and setting the dry brush on fire.  A boar ran out of the burning bushes, and a fish fry became a boar hunt: this is the task for great men!  Androklos killed the boar and founded the city in this place.  
39@This is the tavern of the Adriatic! (Catullus 36.5). Here Romans traveling up the Adriatic put in for a drink and a rest. Here travelers pause after crossing from Brundisium, and commer and trade are lively: we will see great opulence, as its citizens compete wit hthe best states in Greece in wealth.
39@The consuls crossed safely to Dyrrachium, which some consider the same as Epidamnus, because of the following error.  A barbarian king of the region, named Epidamnus, built a city on the sea and named it after himself. Dyrrachus, the son of his daughter and of Neptune (they say), added a dockyard to it, and he named it Dyrrachium.  When the brothers of this Dyrrachus warred against him, Herakles, who was returning from Erythea, formed an alliance with him in exchange for a part of this territory. Thus the Dyrrachians claim Herakles as their founder, because he had a share of their land. They do not dishonor Dyrrachus, but they pride themselves on Herakles even more, as he is a god.   In the battle which ensued, it is said that Herakles killed Ionius, the son of Dyrrachus, by mistake, and that after performing the funeral rites he threw the body into the sea so that it would bear his name.
41@These people celebrate Herakles the Daktyl, not the hero who sailed with our crew! He was one of five Cretan brothers; on the Greek mainland happen at Mykalessos, autumn fruits offered to him stay magically fresh all year; at Megalopolis in Arkadia, his statue is about a cubit high.  He is celebrated as a great wizard and master of initiation.  Cicero suggests that the Idaian Daktyloi, with whom we danced at Cyzicus, make offerings at his tomb. 
44@Baby Zeus was hidden from his cannibalistic father on the heights of this town – if you believe what the locals say! And here earth-born warriors, the Kouretes, leaped from the earth to protect him, and became the foundation of a long line of local priests.
44@Be careful where you bathe! A temple of Hermes and Aphrodite are on the hill, close to the  fountain of Salmakis: in the stream of Salmakis, Heraphroditus, the handsome son of Aphrodites and Hermes, was seized by an amorous nymph, who held him so tightly they fused into one body: legend says that any who bathe in those waters come out a eunuch.
44@Bellerophon settled here, at the will of Athena.
46@Coins of this city tell a sad tale! Here a handsome youth, named Hermias, had a friend among the dolphins, who would let him ride his back across the waves: it seems the dolphin may have been in love with the boy.  That sport cost him his life one day: either a violent storm drowned him in the sea, or the dolphin pierced him accidentally with his fin. Hermias died before his friend could save him; overcome with grief, the dolphin returned his rider’s body to the shore, and then beached himself alongside him and died. 
47@This island is sacred to Hermes, god of travelers and commerce for the Greeks, celebrated here as the ithyphallic Imbramos.
47@The sacred mysteries of the Kabeiroi are celebrated here: we can become initiates!
47@Beneath the sea here, on the trek toward Samothrace, lies the palace of Thetis, mother of Achilles.
47@In the depths of the sea on the cliff  Between Tenedos and craggy Imbros   There is a cave, wide gaping  Poseidon who made the earth tremble  Stopped the horses there 
4@Founded by Miletos: early coins are in the form of arrowheads! We see a sanctuary of Apollo the Healer here.
49@A story of pirates and royal fate lies here: King Katreus of Crete, a grandson of Minos, received an oracular warning that his son Althaimenes would kill him. Althaimenes, eager to flee this fate, left his home and settled here in Kamiros. Many years later, Katreus came to see his son face to fact again. But Althaimenes thought the arriving ships were full of pirates – for Cretans were famous for their skills at plunder. He killed him before he realized what he was doing.  When the truth dawned upon him, he prayed to be swallowed up in the earth.
49@Here at Kamiros, the people celebrate Zeus Mylantios, Zeus of the Mills, who together wit hthe Nymph Himalia taught mankind how to grind grain and bake bread.
50@We sail into the place where gods and giants fought! In the battle of the gods and the giants, Poseidon tore off the island of Saria from Cape Ephialtion in Karpathos and threw it at the Giant Ephialtes; he then buried the giant under the ground. The giant lies submerged beneath the headland that bears his name
52@A young man Kaunos – the son of Miletus and grandson of Apollo – gave this city his name.  He fell deeply in love with his sister Byblis, and fled the country to free himself from this cursed passion. His sister Byblis was disconsolate without him: she wandered from her home, finally taking her own life by hanging herself from a walnut tree. He arrived in Lycia, where Pronoe, a Naiad, arose from the river to share the news of his sister’s death.  He agreed that he would make the Naiad his spouse, in exchange for the kingship of the country.
