The island of Samothrace is the site of mysterious sacred ceremonies honoring the Great Gods of Samothrace, but no one will speak of the details of these secret ceremonies!

The city was founded as a colony of Miletus in the 6th century BC, likely in order to enable exchagne with the local Getic population; in myth, it is the place where Aeetes buried the rescued limbs of his son, carved to pieces by Medea. The city is positioned on a small peninsula on the coastal road between Istros and Byzantium; it benefited from its proximity to the Danube delta. Memnon calls it an emporium (FHG 3, 557). Strabo noted that the hinterland was full of Scordisci, Crobyzi and Troglodytae (Strabo 7.5.12). The city was the setting for Ovid's exile, and a chance for him to reflect on the local non-Greco-Roman population.

You are in Taphia on Taphos the principle island of the Taphii islands off the west coast of Central Greece. Homer references Taphian pirates siezing people as slaves and plundering peoples (Homer Od. 15.9, 16.10)!  You may have even noticed Taphian raiders on your own cloak, Jason (II.747-51)!

Taenarum is an ancient settlement near the tip of a promoter of the southern Peloponnese, known also by the name ""Tainaron"". Pausanias says ""The promontory of Taenarum projects into the sea 150 stades from Teuthrone, with the harbors Achilleius and Psamathus. On the promontory is a temple like a cave, with a statue of Poseidon in front of it. Some of the Greek poets state that Heracles brought up the hound of Hades here, though there is no road that leads underground through the cave, and it is not easy to believe that the gods possess any underground dwelling where the souls collect. But Hecataeus of Miletus gave a plausible explanation, stating that a terrible serpent lived on Taenarum, and was called the hound of Hades, because any one bitten was bound to die of the poison at once, and it was this snake, he said, that was brought by Heracles to Eurystheus.""
