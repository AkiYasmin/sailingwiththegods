The city was founded as a colony of Miletus in the 6th century BC, likely in order to enable exchagne with the local Getic population; in myth, it is the place where Aeetes buried the rescued limbs of his son, carved to pieces by Medea. The city is positioned on a small peninsula on the coastal road between Istros and Byzantium; it benefited from its proximity to the Danube delta. Memnon calls it an emporium (FHG 3, 557). Strabo noted that the hinterland was full of Scordisci, Crobyzi and Troglodytae (Strabo 7.5.12). The city was the setting for Ovid's exile, and a chance for him to reflect on the local non-Greco-Roman population.

Romans were among the most enthusiastic supporters of the Samothracian rites: 64 of the 117 inscriptions which list initiates include or are dedicated by Roman initiates. Roman funds erected monuments and restored damaged buildings, and Roman authors report many ways in which the rites became part of Roman identity. The archaic Roman priesthood of the Salii was linked to the Samothracian cult (Kritolaos BNJ 823 F 1; Servius in Aeneidem 2.235).

Pausanias will later report that the sanctuary of Hera in Samos was established by those who sailed in the Argo, and that these brought the image from Argos! But the Samians themselves will hold that the goddess was born in the island by the side of the river Imbrasus under the withy that continues to grow in the Heraeum (Paus. 7.4).
