Some of them did Ares, bane of men, hungry for the war-cry, take in open fight, others cast he over the crags. Let us, then, go forward behind our hollow shields like a flight of locusts…. In a moment one and all together shall we be wielding the flail, standing up to the spearmen; and dire will be the din when both sides clash rounded shield against rounded shield, and awful the shrieks as they fall one upon another, piercing men's breasts with the spear; and no whit will they draw back for the pounding of the missiles, nay, despite the battery of great hurlstones, the helms shall abide the rattle of war unbowed.%(Tyrtaeus 1.2.2, 7th c BC)"@"Straighaway the red blood ran forth from his mouth, and down he fell in the dust with a moan, and he gnashed his teeth, kicking the ground with his feet…. And those who watched raised their hands, and were like to die with laughter.%(Odyssey 18.90, adapted)"@"As a fire burns through a boundless forest%On the mountain crests, and from far off the glare can be seen:%Just so does the gleam from the polished bronze of armor%Flash through the whole sky, up to the very heavens%(Iliad 1.438-441)"@"Just as great hordes of flies keep swarming around%A sheepfold in spring, when milk overflows the buckets%In such numbers do the pirates board the hapless vessel%(Adapted from Iliad 2.453-4)"@"The leaders in the fights:%His spendid eyes and head like almighty Zeus's'%His thighs like the thighs of Ares, his chest like Poseidon's.%As a bull stands out in a herd above all others,%Sovereign among the cows as they graze in a field:%Just so does Zeus make him stand out, supreme above other leaders%(Adapted from Iliad 2.457-464)"@"They advance with a raucous shouting, like cranes%Whose shrieks fill the sky as they flee from the storms of winter%And the endless rain, and fly toward the river Ocean,%Bringing swift death through the air to the pygmy troops%(Iliad 3.2-5)"@"Catching sight of the enemy as he struts,%As a hungry lion is filled with joy%When he finds a large carcass, a wild goat or a huge stag,%And at once begins to devour it, though dogs and hunters%Keep rushing at him and trying to drive him off:%Just so he rejoices at the sight of his foe%(Adapted from Iliad 3.20-26)"
