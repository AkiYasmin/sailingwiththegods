sailingwiththegods
===================

This game is designed to:

* maximize immersion in the realities of sailing the ancient sea, closing the gap between our modern perspectives of sea travel and ancient realities
* generate data recorded from playersâ€™ behavioral patterns when making choices about how to move about the maritime networks
* integrate ancient voices from history and mythology with geospatial realities of economic resources, political trends and potential for gathering up to date knowledge
